# Exam retake policy

## General Microsoft Certification exam retake policy

- If a candidate does not achieve a passing score on an exam the first time, the candidate must wait 24 hours before retaking the exam. At that time, candidates can log onto their [certification dashboard](https://aka.ms/certdashboard) and reschedule the exam themselves.
- If a candidate does not achieve a passing score the second time, the candidate must wait at least 14 days before retaking the exam a third time.
- A 14-day waiting period is also imposed between the third and fourth attempts and fourth and fifth attempts.
- A candidate may not take a given exam any more than five times within a 12-month period. This 12-month period starts from the first attempt. The candidate is eligible to retake the exam 12 months from the date of their first attempt.
- To take a given exam more than five times per year or to have the time between attempts waived, a candidate must have experienced one of the errors listed below and request an exception from Microsoft.
- You cannot retake an exam that you have passed unless your certification has expired.

## Submit a request for an exam retake exception

To retake an exam without waiting the required amount of time, you must submit a request for an exception. Requests will on be granted if they meet one of the exceptions listed below. Retake exceptions will **not** be granted if the exam failure is due to a candidate’s lack of preparation, knowledge, skill, or ability.

Please submit requests to [mlsecure@microsoft.com](mailto:mlsecure@microsoft.com). Your request must include all of the following information:

- First and last name.
- Candidate ID.
- Email associated with your candidate ID.
- Exam registration ID.
- Exam number.
- Description of error.
- Pearson VUE case number.

If **any** of this information is missing, the retake exception request will be rejected.

## Valid reasons for exam retake exceptions

- Failure due to lab crash.
- Failure due to internet connectivity issues.
- Failure due to equipment failure.

## Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA) and Microsoft Certified Educator (MCE) exam retake policy

- If a candidate does not achieve a passing score on an exam the first time, the candidate must wait 24 hours before retaking the exam.
- If a candidate does not achieve a passing score the second time, the candidate must wait seven days before retaking the exam a third time.
- A seven-day waiting period is imposed between each subsequent exam retake.
- A candidate may not take a given exam any more than five times in a 12-month period. This 12-month period starts from the first attempt. The candidate is then eligible to retake the exam 12 months from the date of the first attempt.
- You cannot retake an exam that you have passed unless your certification has expired.

## Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) exam retake policy

- If a candidate does not achieve a passing score on an exam the first time, the candidate must wait 24 hours before retaking the exam.
- If a candidate does not achieve a passing score the second time, the candidate must wait 2 days (48 hours) before retaking the exam a third time.
- A two-day waiting period will be imposed between each subsequent exam retake.
- There is no annual limit on the number of attempts on the same exam. 
- If a candidate achieves a passing score on an Office exam, the candidate may take it again.

## Beta exam retake policy

- Beta exams may be taken only once during the beta period. If the candidate passes the exam (determined after the beta period ends), it counts toward credit for the certification. If the candidate fails the beta exam, it can be retaken once the exam is live. If the candidate fails the exam once it’s live the general retake policy stated above applies to all subsequent attempts.
- This policy supersedes the general retake policy.
