# Aligning accounts between Certification Profile and Learn Profile

## Why aligning your accounts is important

If you use a different personal Microsoft account (MSA) on Microsoft Learn than the personal account you use to sign into your Microsoft Certification profile and Certification Dashboard, you will not be able to connect your certification profile to your Microsoft Learn profile. Aligning your accounts allows you to solve this issue. There are two ways to align: Change the personal account on your certification profile to align to your Learn profile (recommended) or change the account on your Learn profile to align with your certification profile.

## How to change the personal account on your certification profile to align to your Learn profile (recommended)

1. Go to the [Microsoft Certification Support](https://aka.ms/mcpforum) forum. 
2. Click on "Ask a Question" at the top of the page. 
3. Submit a request to change the personal account (MSA) associated with your Certification profile. 
4. An agent will engage you in a Private Messaging session to verify your personal information.  
5. Once your request has been processed, log into Learn using your Learn personal account (MSA). 
6. Complete the profile connection process. 

## How to change the personal account on your Learn profile to align with your certification profile

You can only have one personal account (MSA) associated with your Learn profile at a time. In order to change it, you must use an alternate work or school (AAD) account to sign in with so that you can remove the current personal account and add a different one.  If you do not have an alternate work or school account, you will have to change the personal account on your certification profile to align to your Learn profile or create a new Learn profile using the same personal account as your certification profile.

- If you already have one or more work or school (AAD) accounts associated with your Learn profile:
    1. Sign in to Learn using a work or school (AAD) account.
    2. Go to the “settings” page in your Learn profile.
    3. Under the “Account management” section, remove your current personal account (MSA).
    4. Select “Add account” and sign in with the personal account (MSA) that you use for your Certification Profile.
    5. Sign out of Microsoft Learn.
    6. Sign in to Microsoft Learn with your newly added personal account (MSA).
    7. Complete the certification profile connection process.
- If you do not yet have a work or school (AAD) address associated with your Learn account but are able to add one:
    1. Sign in to Learn with your current personal account (MSA).
    2. Go to the “settings” page in your Learn profile.
    3. Under the “Account management” section, select “Add account”.
    4. Sign in with your work or school (AAD) account to add it to your Learn profile.
    5. Sign out of Microsoft Learn.
    6. Sign back in to Microsoft Learn using your work or school (AAD) account.
    7. Return to the “Account management” section and remove your personal account (MSA).
    8. Select “Add account” and sign in with the personal account (MSA) that you use for your certification profile to add it to your Learn profile.
    9. Sign out of Microsoft Learn.
    10. Sign in to Microsoft Learn with your newly added personal account (MSA).
    11. Complete the certification profile connection process.
    12. (Optional) Remove your work or school (AAD) account.
