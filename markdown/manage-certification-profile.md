# Manage your certification profile

## What is the certification profile?

Your Microsoft Certification profile is an important source of data. When you take an exam, the proctor will match the information you provide at the time of taking the test to what is in your profile. Therefore, your profile information must be identical to your government-issued identification. If it is not, you will not be able to take the exam. Keeping your profile updated can save you time and hassle.

To manage your certification profile, first you’ll need to sign into your [Certification Dashboard](https://aka.ms/certdashboard) following the steps below.

## How to access and update your certification profile

1. Sign into the Certification Dashboard. For detailed instructions on how to sign in, visit: [Access your Certification Dashboard](/learn/certifications/access-certification-dashboard).

2. In the upper right corner of the page, click “Edit your certification profile”.

## Keeping your Microsoft account active

In order to keep access to your Certification Dashboard, you must keep your Microsoft account active. You can keep it active by signing into your Microsoft account at least once every two years. If your account becomes inactive, you may have to contact support to assist you with a recovery process to regain access to your certification information.
