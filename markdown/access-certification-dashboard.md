# Access your Certification Dashboard

## What is the Certification Dashboard?

Your [Microsoft Certification Dashboard](https://aka.ms/certdashboard) is the home for all of your personal certification-related information. You’ll come here to update your profile, to locate your Microsoft Certification identification number (MCID), and to get your Microsoft Certification transcript. It’s a good place to find anything related to your certifications.

## How to access your Certification Dashboard

1. You can access your Certification Dashboard from any of the following places:
    - Below the description on any certification or exam details page on Microsoft Learn.
