# About online exams with Pearson VUE

## Introduction to online proctored exams with Pearson VUE

Pearson VUE is a company Microsoft partners with to deliver exams. You can take many Microsoft Certification exams using OnVUE online delivery in the comfort of your home or office.

## Participating countries/regions and supported languages

If online exams are available in your country/region, they are available in the same languages that are available in the test centers in your country/region. Please note that greeter support, proctor support, and the proctoring software are available in a limited number of languages. You will select this language during the exam registration process; it may be different than the language in which you take the exam. Most candidates will only have the option to take an online exam with English-language greeter support, proctor support, and the proctoring software, regardless of the language of the exam.

## Before you register for an online exam

1. Make sure your computer meets or exceeds the minimum system requirements (detailed below).
2. Complete the required [system test](https://service.proctorcam.com/system_test?customer=pearson_vue&clientcode=MICROSOFT) on the same computer and in the same location from where you will test.
3. Review the system requirements, technical tips, and testing environment requirements below.
4. Confirm that your ID is compliant with the Pearson VUE [ID Policy](https://home.pearsonvue.com/Policies/1S/English) and that the name on your Microsoft Certification profile EXACTLY matches the name on the government issued ID you will present to enter the exam. To read more about how to check the name on your certification profile, visit: [Manage your certification profile](/learn/certifications/manage-certification-profile).
5. Update your Microsoft Certification profile with your mobile number, including country code, in case Pearson VUE needs to contact you during the exam. If you lose connection during the exam, this is the only way Pearson VUE can contact you. For instructions on how to update your profile, visit: [Manage your certification profile](/learn/certifications/manage-certification-profile).
6. Read the [Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)](/learn/certifications/microsoft-exam-non-disclosure-agreement). At the start of your exam, you must read and agree to the NDA and General Terms of Use for Microsoft Certification Exams. You will only be given 5 minutes to read it once the exam begins. Read it before your exam to ensure that you fully understand the requirements and can agree to them without running out of time. If you do not agree to the NDA in the time allotted, you will not be able to take the exam.
7. If you would like to request accommodations for your exam, please submit an accommodations request with Pearson VUE **before** you schedule your exam. For detailed information on how to submit a request, visit: [Request accommodations for Pearson VUE](/learn/certifications/request-accommodations).

## Run a system test

Run a system test on the same computer and in the same location from where you will test to verify if your computer, location, and internet connection are compatible with the Pearson VUE OnVUE software and testing requirements.

[Run system test now.](https://service.proctorcam.com/system_test?customer=pearson_vue&clientcode=MICROSOFT)

## Technical tips

### Software and permissions

- The user account logged in to the computer you are using should have local administrative permissions. For help on enabling administrative permissions, see documentation for [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-do-i-log-on-as-an-administrator-63267a09-9926-991a-1c77-d203160c8563) and [Mac.](https://support.apple.com/en-lk/guide/mac-help/mtusr001/mac)
- Test on a personal computer rather than a work computer, if possible, because work computers often have software installed that will prevent OnVUE software from launching.
- You may need to configure your internet security and antivirus software to make an exception for the OnVUE Secure Browser executable file.
- Some antivirus software can cause performance issues. Consider disabling antivirus scanning while taking your exam.
- You may need to ensure that your security software does not block the execution of JavaScript, Adobe Air applications, or Adobe Flash Player extensions.

### Network

- Online proctored exams can be disrupted by proxy servers, network packet inspection/filtering, or strict network security configurations.
- When taking an online proctored exam, use a hard-wired internet connection, if possible.
- Do not tether to a mobile hotspot; this is explicitly prohibited.

## Testing environment requirements

To maintain the integrity of online proctored exams, we enforce specific policies, practices, and procedures.

### Office or home setting

Your office or home setting must meet the following requirements:

- Office, conference room, or space at home must be walled, have a closed door, and be free from disruptions.
- No one else can be in or enter the room during your testing session.

### Communicating with the greeter and proctor

- **Phone.** During the check-in process, the greeter will ask for your phone number to communicate with you while you are checking in for your exam. After you have completed the check-in process, you will be asked to place your phone out of reach but close enough to be heard.
- **Chat window.** Most communication with the greeter and proctor occurs via the chat window.
- **Microphone.** During the check-in process and, if necessary, while taking your exam, you can communicate with the greeter and proctor via microphone.
- **Language.** All communication with the greeter and proctor is conducted in a limited number of languages that may be different from the language in which you are taking the exam.

### Identity verification

- You are required to present a current government-issued form of ID, such as one of the following:
  - Driver's license.
  - Military ID.
  - Passport.
  - Identification card (national/state/province identity card).
  - Alien registration card (green card, permanent resident, visa).
  - Government-issued local language ID (not in Roman characters)—accepted only if issued from the country in which the candidate is testing.
- A mobile phone works best for capturing the required headshot and ID, but you can use a webcam if you don’t have a mobile phone.
- The name on the government issued ID you present must **exactly** match the name on your Microsoft Certification and Pearson VUE profiles. 
- If you are in the process of updating or renewing your identification, please note that legal name-change forms, including ID renewal forms, will not be accepted for online proctored exams.
- Minors under the age of 18 are permitted to present a valid student ID as a form of identification. The candidate's guardian must also present a valid ID and must provide verbal consent during the check-in process.

### Exam area scan

- Prior to starting the exam, ensure that all additional monitors are unplugged and turned away from you, and any other computers are turned off and monitors are dark.
- The work area should be clear of all materials, and the following are not allowed within arm's reach: books, notepads, Post-it notes, typed notes/papers, or writing instruments such as pens, markers, whiteboards, or pencils.
- A mobile phone works best for capturing the required exam area photos, but you can use a webcam if you don’t have a mobile phone. If you use your mobile phone, the pictures are uploaded and a greeter will review them along with your headshot and ID. The greeter is looking for security risks and will notify you if anything needs to be addressed prior to launching the exam.

### No personal belongings

- During the exam, you may not access hand-held computers or other electronic devices, pagers, watches, wallets, purses, hats (or other head coverings), bags, coats, books, notes, or any other materials not specifically approved.
- In the event of a support issue, the proctor may try to contact you on your mobile phone at the number you provide during exam check-in. Please ensure your mobile phone number includes the country code. It is acceptable to keep the cell phone nearby but not within arm's reach.
- You may be asked to turn out all your pockets (pants pockets and blazer/sweater pockets) so the greeter can see that they are empty.
- If you are wearing long sleeves, you may be asked to roll up your sleeves to show that there is no writing on your arms.
- If you are wearing a tie, you may be asked to lift the tie to show the greeter that nothing is hidden under the tie.
- If you have long hair that covers your ears, you may be asked to pull your hair back to show the greeter that there is nothing attached to your ear (such as a Bluetooth earpiece).

### No breaks or eating

- Breaks are not allowed during the exam for any reason. You understand and agree that, if you take a break, your exam score will be invalidated, and you will not be allowed to resume the exam later.
- Eating, smoking, and chewing gum are prohibited during the exam. You may have a glass of water in a clear container if you will need something to drink during the exam.

### No exam assistance

- No one can enter the room during your testing session. If this occurs, your exam will be terminated.
- You may not receive assistance or coaching from other individuals while taking the exam, and you may not allow other individuals to see the computer screen during the exam.
- You are not allowed to use books or other resources, scratch paper, erasable whiteboards or similar, or writing instruments, such as a pen, marker, or pencil, during exam delivery.
- The proctor cannot answer questions related to exam content. If you have questions related to exam content, please contact Microsoft after you complete the exam.

### Facial Comparison Policy

- By registering for an online proctored exam delivery, you understand and agree that Pearson VUE may use facial comparison technology for the purpose of verifying your identity during the testing process. It will compare your facial image to the one on your identification and to facial images captured during the testing process to help us further develop, upgrade, and improve this application. If you do not agree to this, please schedule the exam at a test center.

### Recording during the exam

- When taking the exam, the proctor will continuously monitor you by video and audio. The entire session will be recorded. Monitoring will include your face (eye movements, head movements), voice, the physical room where you are seated, and the location during the exam. If you do not wish to be recorded (either by video or audio), please notify the proctor immediately. You will NOT be able to proceed with the exam.

## Non-Disclosure Agreement

- As with any other Microsoft Certification exam, you must read and agree to the terms stated in our [NDA](/learn/certifications/microsoft-exam-non-disclosure-agreement). You will only be given 5 minutes to read it once the exam begins, therefore we recommend that you read it before your exam to ensure you fully understand the requirements and can agree to them without running out of time. If you do not agree to the NDA in the time allotted you will not be able to take the exam.
- You must also comply with the candidate conduct requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
  - You may not copy or record questions or answers from the exam using any means.
  - You may not share or discuss the questions or answers seen in the exam with others.
- If you do not follow the [Candidate Rules Agreement](https://www.pearsonvue.com/rp/rp_candidate_rules_agreement.pdf) or are suspected of cheating or tampering with software from Pearson VUE or its subcontractor, or if someone other than you is detected in the room where you are seated during the exam, the proctor will immediately terminate the exam and report the infraction to Microsoft, along with audio and/or video evidence. Your exam may be invalidated, and Microsoft may take other action, such as decertifying you and/or banning you from the Microsoft Certification Program.

## Register for an online exam

For detailed instructions on how to register, visit: [Register and schedule an exam](/learn/certifications/register-schedule-exam).

## Launching the exam and the check-in process

The launch and check-in process should take approximately 15 minutes.

- Before launching your exam, review the OnVUE [FAQs](https://home.pearsonvue.com/microsoft/onvue) for troubleshooting tips.
- On exam day, run the [system test](https://service.proctorcam.com/system_test?customer=pearson_vue&clientcode=MICROSOFT) again on the equipment and internet connection you will use during the exam. Internet bandwidth can change at any time.
- Log onto your computer as an administrator so you can determine if any background processes are running and stop them.
- Turn off browser pop-up blockers.
- Make sure you have your mobile phone outside of the immediate testing space but within hearing distance in the event the exam proctor needs to contact you.
  - Make sure that your Microsoft Certification profile is updated with your mobile number, including country code, in case Pearson VUE need to contact you during the exam.

To begin your testing session and connect with a greeter:

1. Sign in to your [Certification Dashboard](https://aka.ms/certdashboard) with the email associated with your Microsoft Certification profile. (If you cannot access your Microsoft Certification Dashboard at this step first, try again using an Incognito or InPrivate browser. If you still cannot access your Certification Dashboard, open a case with [certification support](https://aka.ms/mcpforum), and a forum moderator will assist.)
2. We recommend signing in 15 minutes early to start the check-in process. YOU WILL ONLY HAVE 15 minutes after your scheduled appointment time to begin the exam process.
3. In the Appointments section on the right, find your exam appointment and select “Start online exam”. You will be redirected to Pearson VUE.
4. Select the exam name under “Purchased Online Exams”.
5. Select “Begin exam” and proceed through the self-check-in process and wait for a proctor to connect with you. (Note: You must select “Begin exam” to launch the exam; if you do not, the exam will not launch.) 
6. If you are not connected to a proctor 30 minutes after your scheduled exam time, the connection was lost. You can reschedule your exam 24 to 30 hours after the original exam appointment. Just log onto your [Certification Dashboard](https://aka.ms/certdashboard) with the email associated with your Microsoft Certification profile to reschedule. We recommend that you self-serve as much as possible, but you can also contact [Pearson VUE support](https://home.pearsonvue.com/microsoft/contact) for help to reschedule an exam. Please be patient as the responses are slower than normal due to COVID-19 (up to five days).
7. Identity verification and room scans are done by the greeter upon completion of the self-check-in. If no issues or concerns are identified during the greeter review of these artifacts, you will be placed in the proctor queue. As soon as a proctor is available, you will be able to begin your exam. In the cases where the greeter has questions about the artifacts provided, the greeter will work with you to resolve them.
8. After this process is complete, the exam will begin. Your proctor will not contact you during the exam unless there is an issue.
9. If there is a technical issue during exam delivery, the proctor will first attempt to contact you via chat. If that doesn't work, the proctor will contact you by phone.
10. If there is an issue after the exam, [contact Pearson VUE support.](https://home.pearsonvue.com/contact) Please have the Incident Report number provided by your proctor available.

## Retrieve score report

Visit: [How to access your score report](/learn/certifications/exam-scoring-reports#how-to-access-your-score-report).

## Remove proctor software

When your exam ends, you should remove all executable and ancillary files, including the **Pearson VUE Secure Browser**. To remove the Pearson VUE Secure Browser, follow the standard application [uninstall process for Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uninstall-or-remove-apps-and-programs-in-windows-10-4b55f974-2cc6-2d2b-d092-5905080eaf98) or [uninstall process for Mac.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202235)
