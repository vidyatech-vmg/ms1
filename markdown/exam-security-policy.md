# Exam security policy

## About exam security

We make every attempt to ensure the security of our exams and testing process. As part of this, we will take actions like banning candidates who violate our testing rules as described here and in the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), closing testing centers if we have security concerns, and asking candidates to retake exams if we suspect fraudulent activity.

## Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)

The Microsoft Certification Program requires candidates to accept the terms of a [Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)](/learn/certifications/microsoft-exam-non-disclosure-agreement) before taking an exam. The NDA legally requires candidates to keep information related to exam content confidential. Requiring the acceptance of the NDA helps protect the security of Microsoft Certification exams and the integrity of the Microsoft Certification Program by legally discouraging piracy and/or unauthorized use of exam content.

## Testing center security

Staff at testing centers are provided with security policies that must be enforced in order to acquire and maintain testing center status. Ongoing inspections ensure that each testing center maintains the security outlined by Microsoft and the exam delivery provider. In addition, proctors at testing centers are authorized to immediately take appropriate measures against candidates who violate testing rules. If you have a concern about the security of your exam experience, please send an email to [mlsecure@microsoft.com](mailto:mlsecure@microsoft.com).

To ensure the security of Microsoft Certification exams, testing center administrators ensure that the identification provided is appropriate and verify that it is the ID of the person who appeared to take the exam; walk through the testing area periodically; keep partitions between testing stations; remove crib sheets, electronic devices, and other unauthorized materials, and prevent the removal of exam content in any shape or form. In addition, test center administrators and proctors cannot provide any type of aid with regard to any exam question. They can help resolve technical issues but cannot assist in the understanding or answering of any exam question.

Microsoft may suspend testing at any test center where security problems are suspected, including any test centers that might be affiliated with those under suspicion.

### Testing center appeal process

Testing center owners can appeal a site closure by submitting an appeal to [mlsecure@microsoft.com](mailto:mlsecure@microsoft.com).

## Out-of-country testing

To sit for a Microsoft Certification exam at a testing center in India, China, or Pakistan, you must be a legitimate resident of that country. If you are a legitimate resident of one of these countries, testing are required to confirm and record that you have shown documented proof that they are a legitimate resident of that specific country. To verify country of residence status, you are required to present two forms of original (no photocopies), valid (unexpired) ID:

- A government issued ID with your name, photo, and signature and  
- An ID with your name and signature.

If you are not a legitimate resident of India, China, or Pakistan, you will **not** be allowed to sit for a Microsoft Certification exam within that country.

## Right of exclusion

Based on security and integrity concerns, Microsoft reserves the right to exclude specific regions, countries, and testing centers from the Microsoft Certification Program altogether.

## Data forensics

Microsoft will use data forensics (statistical evidence improper activity during an exam) to cancel exam scores, revoke certifications, ban candidates, close test centers, and take any other appropriate action to protect the integrity of the Microsoft Certification Program. 

## Candidate retesting at request of Microsoft

- Microsoft reserves the right to ask any candidate to retest for any suspected fraudulent activity or anomalous testing patterns at any time.
- Retesting will take place at a facility that is selected by Microsoft at a time agreed upon by Microsoft and the candidate.

## Revoking certifications

If a candidate violates any testing rule, exam policy, or term within the exam agreement (NDA), or engages in any misconduct that diminishes the security and integrity of the Microsoft Certification Program in any way, the candidate may be permanently prohibited from taking any future Microsoft Certification exams. In addition, the candidate may be decertified from the Microsoft Certification Program, and test scores and certifications may be revoked.

## Candidate bans

If a candidate violates any testing rule, exam policy, or term within the exam agreement (NDA), or engages in any misconduct that diminishes the security and integrity of the Microsoft Certification Program in any way, the candidate may be permanently prohibited from taking any future Microsoft Certification exams. In addition, test scores and certifications may be revoked.

Examples of such misconduct, misuse, and fraud include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Falsifying score reports, by modifying and/or altering the original results/score reports for any exam record.
- Cheating during the exam (such as looking at the monitors of other exam takers, using an unauthorized device, or looking at notes).
- Providing or accepting improper assistance.
- Bringing non-authorized items into the testing center during an exam session (such as notes or unauthorized materials and electronic devices, such as cell phones).
- Using unauthorized material in attempting to satisfy certification requirements (this includes using brain dump material and/or unauthorized publication of exam questions with or without answers).
- Falsifying identity or impersonating another individual to gain access to an exam.
- Misconduct as determined by statistical analysis.
- Copying, publishing, disclosing, transmitting, selling, offering to sell, posting, downloading, distributing in any way, or otherwise transferring, modifying, making derivative works of, reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, or translating any exam in whole or in part, in any form or by any means, verbal or written, electronic or mechanical, for any purpose.
- Disclosing Microsoft intellectual property (IP).
- Disseminating actual exam content.
- Using the exam content in any manner that violates applicable law.
- Violating the current exam retake policy.
- Violating the Microsoft non-disclosure agreement (NDA) in any way.
- Violating the agreement with the exam delivery provider in any way.

## Candidate appeal process

Candidates may appeal their ban by submitting an appeal to [mlsecure@microsoft.com](mailto:mlsecure@microsoft.com).

A candidate may appeal a ban for falsifying a score report by submitting the original report (no scans or electronic copies) to:

  Microsoft Worldwide Learning Security Team  
  One Microsoft Way  
  Redmond, WA 98052

The Microsoft Worldwide Learning Security Team will review all submitted appeal requests, conduct a thorough investigation of each specific case, and will communicate directly with the candidate regarding the conclusion of the investigation and final appeal decision.

## Examples of fraudulent activity

Fraudulent activity is anything that enables an unqualified candidate to pass an exam. This type of egregious misconduct negatively affects the integrity of the Microsoft Certification Program. Examples of fraudulent activity include, but are not limited to proxy testing, using brain dump sites to prepare for the exam, stealing content to share with others, falsifying score reports, colluding with proctors, etc.

Proxy testing is when someone takes an exam for another candidate. Some companies offer proxy testing, guaranteeing that you will pass the exam without having to take it. This is fraudulent activity. 

A brain dump is a source, such as a website, that contains certification exam content that has been fraudulently obtained with the intention to share it with or sell it to exam candidates. The content included in brain dumps is exactly the same or substantially similar to items appearing on the exam. Because the exam content was fraudulently obtained, using this type of material to prepare for or during an exam constitutes cheating. Brain dump providers are in violation of Microsoft intellectual property rights and nondisclosure agreements. If you think you have discovered a brain dump site with Microsoft content, please inform us by sending an email to [mlsecure@microsoft.com](mailto:mlsecure@microsoft.com).

Falsified score reports are reports that Microsoft deems to be inauthentic or that deceive or defraud others in any way. If Microsoft determines that a candidate has falsified a score report, the candidate will be ineligible to take any future Microsoft exams and his or her certifications may be revoked.
