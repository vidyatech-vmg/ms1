# Prepare for an exam

## Understand which skills to prepare

On every certification and exam details page, you’ll find a “Skills measured” section that lists skills that will be assessed as well as a downloadable detailed outline. To help you prepare for the exam, a few training options are available.

## Self-paced learning on Microsoft Learn

A curated list of free online learning paths is available on each certification and exam details page to help you prepare. You can also [browse all learning paths and modules](/learn/browse/) based on product (for example, Azure, Microsoft 365, Windows), based on role (such as developer or data engineer), or based on learning level (beginner, intermediate, and advanced).

Self-paced learning content on Microsoft Learn has interactive step-by-step and bite-size tutorials and modules. This content helps build necessary technical skills to advance your knowledge and ability to address solutions. They’re browser-based trainings and are available to complete at your own pace.

## Instructor-led training

Find relevant instructor-led training courses to prepare for your exam on the detail pages, or you can [browse all instructor-led courses](/learn/certifications/courses/browse/). If you’re looking for in-depth, structured training, instructor-led training offers dedicated, personal attention and support from technical subject matter experts.

Online or in-person classes and workshops are centered around Microsoft Official Courses, which are kept up-to-date and aligned to help you prepare for certification. They are delivered by Microsoft Certified Trainers offered by Microsoft Learning Partners.

## Take a practice test

[Official Microsoft Practice Tests](https://aka.ms/practicetests) are offered by MeasureUp and can help you be prepared on test day.

## Hire a Microsoft Certified Trainer

See if your workplace will host a Microsoft Certified Trainer for in-person training. Our worldwide [training partner network](/learn/certifications/partners) makes it possible that a trainer can deliver a specific course for your team.
