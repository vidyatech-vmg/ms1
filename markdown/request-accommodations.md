# Request accommodations

## When an accommodation is needed

We’re committed to ensuring that every person who’s interested in taking Microsoft Certifications can do so in a way that is fair and accurately reflects their skills and abilities. This means providing accommodations when needed. Accommodations can include special equipment for those with low vision or who are hard of hearing, breaks for medical reasons, or extra time for testing because the exam is not in your native language.

Examples of situations requiring accommodations include but are not limited to needing:

- Extra time due to a temporary or permanent condition, such as ADHD, PTSD, or anxiety during exams.
- A multiple monitor setup or physical magnification device if you are a person with low vision.
- To use noise cancelling headphones or a white noise device to improve focus.
- A reader/scribe to assist with the check-in process and/or to take the exam.

Because the proctoring process is designed to ensure the integrity of the certification process, it involves a strict set of guidelines that are used to monitor candidates during the exam. As a result, you may need to request an accommodation for behaviors that the proctor may flag as potential security violations if they are not aware of the reason for them. For example, you may also require an accommodation if you:

- Move around the room during the exam to improve focus.
- Move around the room or stand during the exam because of difficulty remaining seated for extended periods.
- Frequently look away from the monitor to rest your eyes or to focus your attention.
- Noticeably fidget such that people would notice.
- Are unable to rearrange your home test environment to meet the standard requirements.

If requested, the proctoring standards can also be adjusted when necessary to provide the appropriate accommodations that will best ensure the fairness of your exam delivery.

## How to request exam accommodations

The process for requesting accommodations depends on which of our exam delivery providers you will be taking your exam with. However, the process of requesting and granting accommodations can take several weeks to complete, so be sure to begin this process early to secure accommodations you require. Requests for accommodations need to be made ***before*** you register for your exam so that the exam delivery provider has time to evaluate your request and provide the accommodation. **You should not register for the exam until you have the accommodation in place.**

If you are not sure which exam delivery provider to select, visit: [How to choose an exam delivery provider](/learn/certifications/register-schedule-exam#how-to-choose-an-exam-delivery-provider).
