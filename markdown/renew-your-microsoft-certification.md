# Renew your Microsoft Certification

Microsoft Certifications validate having relevant skills and knowledge needed to successfully perform in job roles for a modern digital business. Certifications can help open career opportunities and demonstrate your ability to support your organization’s digital transformation. And, given the speed at which technology evolves in a cloud world, it’s important to keep your skills current and your certification active.

On December 15, Microsoft [introduced a new approach](https://aka.ms/CertRenewalBlog) to help learners stay current. Those who have an active certification expiring within six months can renew their certification annually – at no cost – by passing a renewal assessment on Microsoft Learn.

## Certification renewal schedule

Approximately six months after role-based and specialty certifications have been in market, associated renewal assessments and collections of learning modules will be made available on Microsoft Learn. Renewal assessments will be updated in alignment with updates made to certification exams.

When you’re eligible to renew your certification, you’ll be notified via email linked with your Microsoft Certification ID (MCID). You will receive up to four email reminders before your certification expires. After you have renewed your certification, you’ll no longer receive reminders until it’s time to renew again.

Check out the following roadmap (subject to change) as we initially launch renewal assessments for certifications that have been in the market.

## Changes to certification expiration policy

On December 15, 2020 we [announced a change in certification expiration policy](https://aka.ms/CertRenewalBlog). Starting in June 2021, any [role-based](/learn/certifications/browse/?type=role-based) or [specialty certification](/learn/certifications/browse/?type=specialty) earned will be valid for one year from the date you earned it. Any role-based and specialty certifications earned before June 2021 will remain valid for two years from the date you earned it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

For more information, check out frequently asked questions about renewing Microsoft Certifications.

1. **Can I renew my certification before I receive notifications that I’m eligible to do so?**

    No, the renewal assessment on Microsoft Learn is only available once you're eligible – approximately six months before your certification expires. You will receive a notification email from Microsoft, alerting you when the renewal assessment is available.

2. **Is it mandatory for me to connect my certification profile to my Docs profile on Microsoft Learn?**

    Yes, connecting your certification profile enables you to take the renewal assessment on Microsoft Learn when you’re within the eligibility window. You’ll also have a more personalized experience.

    For optimal experience, we recommend using the same account credentials for both your certification profile and Docs profile on Microsoft Learn. Please note that only one certification profile can be connected to one Docs profile, and it cannot be changed later. So, if you have multiple certification profiles, please [contact our certification support team](https://aka.ms/mcpforum) to merge your Microsoft Certification profiles before connecting to your Docs profile.

3. **What’s the difference between my Microsoft Certification profile and Docs profile on Microsoft Learn?**

    Your Microsoft Certification profile holds the record of your certification history with Microsoft, and you access it with a personal Microsoft account. If you have registered for a Microsoft Certification exam or accessed the Certification Dashboard, you have a Microsoft Certification profile.

    Your Docs profile on Microsoft Learn includes activity history across Microsoft Learn, Docs, Q&A, and code samples. You access it using either a personal Microsoft account or a work or school account.

4. **My certification expired. What happens now?**

    If your certification expires, you must earn the certification again by passing the required exam(s).

5. **Can I renew my certification by passing a beta exam or by retaking an exam before my certification expires?**

    No. To renew your certification, you need to pass the renewal assessment before your certification expires.

6. **Do all Microsoft Certifications have the option to renew?**

    Microsoft role-based and specialty certifications that have been available for more than six months will have the renewal option.

7. **Do I need to renew my Microsoft fundamentals certification?**

    No. The certification renewal process does not apply to fundamentals certifications since they do not expire.

8. **Are the renewal assessments aligned to the regular exam update cadence?**

    Yes, updates to the assessments are aligned with certification exam updates.

9. **Which languages are assessments available in?**

10. **How many times can I retake the assessment?**

    You may retake the assessment as many times as you need to take it to pass, and you must pass before your certification expires. If you do not pass the first time, you may immediately attempt the assessment again. However, after the second try, you must wait at least 24 hours before any additional attempts.

11. **If I renew my expert level role-based certification and it includes an associate-level pre-requisite certification, does my associate-level certification also automatically renew?**

    No. Each certification must be renewed separately by passing the associated assessment.

12. **My expert-level certification requires achieving an associate-level certification as a pre-requisite. If the associate-level certification expires, will my expert level automatically expire too?**

    No, your expert-level certification will not automatically expire if your associate-level pre-requisite certification expires. Each certification must be renewed separately by passing the associated assessment.
