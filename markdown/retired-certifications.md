# Certification retirement

## Why certifications get retired

Technology and associated job roles change faster every year. To keep our certification program relevant, we continually review our exams and certifications to ensure they reflect the latest skills and Microsoft technologies and retire those that are no longer relevant. Our goal is to empower candidates to be on the leading edge of tech, in high demand cloud-based job roles, and we do this by providing certifications for critical job roles that help organizations with their digital transformations. For more details on this, visit: [Updating Microsoft Certifications: How we keep them relevant â€“ Microsoft Tech Community.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-learn-blog/updating-microsoft-certifications-how-we-keep-them-relevant/ba-p/1469425)

## Recently retired certifications 

These certifications have been retired within the last year. When a certification has been retired for more than one year, it will be removed from this page. Once a certification has been retired, it will no longer be available in the Microsoft Learn course or certification offerings. If you earned a certification before it was retired, it will remain on your transcript.

Certifications will remain in the Active section of your transcript for two years after they retire. After two years, they will be moved to the Certification History section of your transcript.
