# Register and schedule an exam

## How to register for an exam

If you haven’t decided which exam to take, start from the [certification overview](/learn/certifications/) or [browse all certifications](/learn/certifications/browse/) to discover which certification is right for you. Once you are prepared and ready to schedule your exam, you can register from any exam details page. On certification detail pages, you’ll find the option to register in the “Certification exams” section, and on the exam detail pages, the option is in the “Schedule exam” section.

## <a name="how-to-choose-an-exam-delivery-provider"></a> How to choose an exam delivery provider

Microsoft partners with multiple exam delivery providers to administer certification exams for different types of candidates. Here’s how to choose which exam delivery provider to register with:

- Some exams will only offer one provider option. These exams are delivered by Pearson VUE.
- For exams with multiple provider options, individuals taking a certification exam on their own or as part of a training program should select “Schedule with Pearson VUE”.
- For students, members of academic institutions, and candidates taking Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) exams, select “Schedule with Certiport”.
- For job seekers impacted by COVID-19 who want to access a discounted exam, select “Register for USD15” and follow the instructions to use this offer. These exams are only available with online proctoring and are delivered by PSI.

## Decide whether to take your exam at a test center or use online proctoring

During the scheduling process, some providers give you the option to take the exam in a local test center or online. Each has benefits. Local test centers provide a quiet testing environment and a computer that meets Microsoft’s minimum standards. With an online proctored exam, you can take your exam from almost anywhere, but you’ll be using your own computer. Note that the USD15 offer is only available through online proctoring delivered by PSI.

## Run a system pre-check

If you’ll be taking your exam online, you should run a system pre-check to ensure your machine meets the requirements **before** you register for the exam. If you’re taking the exam with a different computer, you should run the system check on that machine.

For detailed instructions on how to take the system pre-check for your selected exam delivery provider, visit: [about online exams with Pearson VUE](/learn/certifications/online-exams) or [about online exams with PSI](/learn/certifications/online-exams-psi). Certiport does not offer online proctored exams at this time.

3. Provide your legal name and contact information or verify that it is up to date. Make sure that your name matches what is on the identification you will present at your scheduled exam appointment; if it doesn’t match, you will not be able to sit for the exam. For more details, visit: [Manage your certification profile](/learn/certifications/manage-certification-profile). Once your profile is complete, select “Save and continue” (or “Continue” if you are verifying).

4. On the next screen, employees of certain companies and attendees of some Microsoft events can claim discounts. Available discounts are listed at the top of the page. You can also check eligibility for other email addresses you might use (e.g., your work email address; another personal email address). For more detailed information, visit: [Vouchers and redeeming discounts](/learn/certifications/redeem-discounts). Once your discounts are claimed, select “Schedule exam”, and you will be redirected to your selected exam delivery provider to schedule your exam.

5. Follow the on-screen steps to select a proctoring method (if available), schedule your exam appointment, and complete payment (if applicable).

6. Once registered, your appointment should appear in the [Certification Dashboard.](https://aka.ms/certdashboard) You can also cancel or reschedule your appointment here if you need. If you are taking an online exam, you will start your exam from here as well.
