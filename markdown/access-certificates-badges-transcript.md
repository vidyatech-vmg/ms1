# Access your certificates, badges, and transcript

## What are certificates, badges, and the transcript?

You’ll need your Microsoft Certification certificates, badges, and transcript as proof of your accomplishments. Use badges on your LinkedIn profile or career-related social media posts to share your skills in a simple, trusted way.

To access your certificates, badges, and transcript, first you’ll need to go to your Certification Dashboard.

## How to access your Certification Dashboard

Visit: [Access your Certification Dashboard](/learn/certifications/access-certification-dashboard).

## How to access your certificates

1. From your Certification Dashboard, click on the “View Certificates” button in the “Certificates” section.
2. To download, click “download” in the lower right on the “Certificates” icon.
3. This will list the certificates that you have earned. Click the box next to the name of the certificate to select it.
4. You can preview a single selected certificate, or you can download a .zip file with multiple certificates selected.

## How to access your badges

Visit: [Use and share certification badges](/learn/certifications/badges).

## How to access your transcript

From your Certification Dashboard, click on the “View Transcript” button in the “Transcript” section.

- To email a copy of your transcript, select the “Email” button. 
- To download a PDF copy of your transcript, select the “PDF” button. 
- To share a copy of your transcript, select the “Share” button. You will be shown a transcript ID and will need to create an access code for your transcript and can select if you want it to include address details. Selecting “Share” will generate a URL where someone can provide your transcript ID and access code to view it.

## If you don’t see a certificate that you earned or are unable to download

Note that if the certification you are working toward requires two or more exams, you will not receive the certificate until you pass the final exam.

For help finding a certificate that you earned, or with downloading, visit: [Certification support](/learn/certifications/help).
