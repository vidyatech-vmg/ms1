## About student discounts

We are pleased to offer academic pricing on Microsoft Certification exams in most countries/regions (except India and China). To qualify for the student discount, you must first identify yourself as a student in your Microsoft Certification profile and then verify your academic status. Once verified, you will be able to receive the student discount when registering for an exam.
