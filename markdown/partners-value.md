# Value of Learning Partners

## How Learning Partners help IT professionals and developers

**Learn a new skill.** With just one course, you can develop practical skills that cover the technology adoption life cycle—from planning to implementation to support. And you gain a level of proficiency that can only be taught through hands-on labs, simulations, and the real-world application of skills.

**Prepare for certification.** Microsoft Official Courses are built with Microsoft Certification in mind and are taught by qualified industry instructors.

**Start a new career.** The industry instructors who teach Microsoft Official Courses can help you gain IT skills that directly transfer from the classroom to the workplace. Courses offer access to valuable digital resources that remain available to you long after you complete a course.
